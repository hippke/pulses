### Periodic Spectral Modulations arise from non-random spacing of spectral absorption lines

The code in this repository ("make_figure.py") reads the solar spectrum by [Kurucz (2005)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2005MSAIS...8..189K/abstract), performs a spectral Fourier transform, and outputs the Figure shown below. It is intended to accompany the paper and allow for reproducible science.
